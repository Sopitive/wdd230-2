          <p>
            The good and Beauiful blog uses great white space by not having it
            full of words. It has little words and shows a very clean design to
            its page.

          <h3>Visual Hierarchy</h3>

          />
          <p>
            The good and beautiful website uses Visual Hierarchy by having the
            heading and words start out with big. Then to the next smaller size
            then to the next smaller size after that. It repeats that concept on
            all parts of the website.

            alt="picture of good and beautiful youtube"
          />
          <p>
            The good and beautiful youtube page uses repetition with all its
            elements in the youtube page is repeated over and over with each
            video and channels it has out.
